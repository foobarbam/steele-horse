## Expert IT and Cloud Computing Services

![Hello](hello.jpg#floatright)

Steele Horse LLC offers expert [Information Technology -IT-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology) services for [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing), [hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Hybrid), and on premises hosting, as well as commercial and [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) software implementation services.  With 20+ years of experience in Fortune 500 companies and startups we can help transform your business.

Steele Horse LLC was started to provide high level information technology services at reasonable prices.   Properly applied, cloud technologies can [save money](https://technologyadvice.com/blog/information-technology/4-ways-cloud-computing-can-save-money/#:~:text=Cloud%20computing%20is%20cost%2Deffective,are%20all%20expenses%20that%20disappear.) versus traditional hosted or in-house platforms.  We have the experience and knowledge to help you take advantage of these rapidly evolving technologies.

My passion for technology was ignited in the late 1990â€™s when I turned an old [486 dx2 PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_DX2) into a dial up firewall using [Red Hat Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux).  This led me to pursue a Bachelor of Science majoring in Computer Science at [Wichita State University](https://wichita.edu).

While acquiring my degree, I worked part time managing the network of a small aerospace engineering firm as well as designing and programming websites.  Upon graduation I have worked for local non-profits, the Fortune 500 companies [Spirit AeroSystems](https://spiritaero.com) and [IBM](https://ibm.com), and the startup [Armis Inc](https://armis.com).  My career has taken me around the world installing multi million dollar data centers, training others in various countries, and I have deployed my code around the world.  It brings me pride to know my digital DNA is a part of The Internet.  In ten years I went from barely traveling through three or four states to having visited and worked in five different countries and ten different states in the US.

Throughout my corporate career I have focused on Open Source technologies and cloud computing and the two are intertwined and forever married to one another.  The cloud and The Internet is built on [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and my passion and extensive experience with these platforms can help your business transform.
