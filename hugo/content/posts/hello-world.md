## [Hello World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)


I can't imagine how many times I have typed that phrase.  Hundreds over the past twenty plus years I am sure.  It's the traditional first line of a code when learning a new programming language.  Here I am again writing it once more.  This time for my first blog post.

This is my new site.  I have created it for a few reasons.   I needed a better Internet prcesence and have been warning to do this quite some time, I needed an outlet to keep my [skills](/resume/) fresh, I need a [portfolio](https://github.com/foobarbam/) to exhibit my skills, and I want to start my own business.

My friend over at [Land a DevOps Job](https://landadevopsjob.com/) has a blog post titled [Terraform Certification: The Last Resort](https://landadevopsjob.com/blog/terraform-certification-the-last-resort/) and in that article he argues that certifications are great but portfolios are better.  To that end, he suggests [The Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) and I thought that to be a lovely idea.  I opted to host my site on AWS, use Terraform to manage it, and Hugo for content management.  

It's not done yet, but getting there.  If anyone is interested in the underlying code check out my [cloud resume challenge repository on github](https://github.com/foobarbam/steele-horse).
